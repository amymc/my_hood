This is a responsive, location-based, events listing website. 

Built using **Ruby on Rails**, **Twitter Bootstrap** and the **Google Maps API**, it uses **HTML5 Geolocation** to detect the user's location and, based on this, returns suggestions of things-to-do nearby. 

Screenshots can be viewed [here] (http://amymc.github.io/my_hood/)
